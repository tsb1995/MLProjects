# Audio Classification

This repository contains an audio classification task developed in Jupyter Notebooks from following Seth Adams' [Deep Learning for Audio Classification](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7YM-HAz-IY&list=PLhA3b2k8R3t2Ng1WW_7MiXeh1pfQJQi_P&index=1) series. In it we begin with a labeled dataset consisting of .wav files with audio from a variety of instruments. In our [cleanup](./cleanup.ipynb) file, we read in the data and visualize Time Series, Fourier Transforms, Filter Bank Coeffecients, and MFCCs based on the data. We then create envelopes for each and save the data.
